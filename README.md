# Easy Buffer Tool Prototype
Testing feasibility of using [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), [Leaflet.draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) & [Leaflet.buffer](https://github.com/skeate/Leaflet.buffer) with [Leaflet.TouchHover](https://github.com/mourner/Leaflet.TouchHover) for mobile support, as a lightweight application to aid in a SAR or recovery situation. Simple search buffer parameters pulled from *[Lost Person Behavior](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Person-Behavior-search-rescue/dp/1879471396)* by **Robert J. Kloester**, 2008.
